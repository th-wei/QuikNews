<Person1>Welcome to Daily Metis News - Keep up with Metis on tech and business. Good morning! Let's jump right in. The big story today is a massive trade sweep by President Trump.
</Person1><Person2>It's huge. The new reality seems to be that in the Trump-dominated global economy, the U.S. gets a lot, but gives... well, practically nothing in return.
</Person2><Person1>Exactly. Courtenay Brown is reporting on these asymmetric trade deals. The White House is touting them, but what it really shows is how far other countries, specifically Europe and Japan, will go just to keep access to the U.S. market.
</Person1><Person2>And the details are pretty stark. They've agreed to drop their tariff rates to zero, promised these eye-popping investments in the U.S., and opened up their markets. And what do they get?
</Person2><Person1>They get... some assurance on their own tariff rate, which is set at fifteen percent. That's it! And the E.U. deal was announced yesterday at Trump's golf resort in Scotland, just days before a thirty percent levy was set to hit them.
</Person1><Person2>Right. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said it brings "stability." But when a reporter asked what the U.S. conceded, she had no answer.
</Person2><Person1>Former Ambassador Gordon Sondland put it bluntly to Axios. He said Europe "gets no trade war." That's the concession. He said, and I'm quoting, "No one fully valued how much leverage our market creates when it comes to trade negotiations until Trump."
</Person1><Person2>But I have to push back on that a little. Is that a sustainable long-term strategy? Sure, you get short-term wins. But opening markets only helps if foreigners are actually willing to buy American goods. Think about U.S. cars in Japan... that's not always a sure thing.
</Person2><Person1>That's the big unknown, you're right. And all this talk of tariffs brings us to the actual revenue. The numbers are staggering. Madison Mills reports the government has generated an extra $20 billion each of the past two months.
</Person1><Person2>That could be two hundred and forty billion dollars in additional revenue this year. And when you look at where it's coming from, it's clear who's feeling the squeeze. Motor vehicles brought in three-point-four billion in May alone. That's over fourteen percent of the total.
</Person2><Person1>I see. So car companies and, by extension, car buyers are at the heart of this. Vehicle parts added another one-point-two billion, and even lithium-ion E.V. batteries contributed almost half a billion dollars.
</Person1><Person2>And that's why we're seeing this fascinating consumer behavior. Joann Muller's reporting shows middle-income Americans are now accelerating their car-buying plans. They're worried about prices going even higher!
</Person2><Person1>It's a complete reversal! For two years, people were delaying purchases. Now, fifty-five percent are considering buying in the next year. They see the writing on the wall with these tariffs and they're trying to act before prices jump again.
</Person1><Person2>It’s a roller coaster. Sales surged, then normalized as Trump waffled on policy, and now... with these new deals, there's renewed urgency. It's confounding for everyone.
</Person2><Person1>Let's pivot from the economy to health-tech. There's this incredible story about GLP-1 drugs. We all know them for weight loss, like Ozempic, but the biggest buzz now has nothing to do with that.
</Person1><Person2>It's amazing. They're being called "the everything drug." These treatments have been found to lower the risk of... well, everything! Alzheimer's, addiction, sleep apnea, even seizures and bacterial infections. The list just keeps growing.
</Person2><Person1>Got it. So this was driven by a huge study of Veterans Health Administration records, right? Almost two million patients.
</Person1><Person2>Yes, and the findings were profound. In many cases, they found a ten to twenty percent reduced risk for diseases that have very few effective treatments. It's modest, but for these conditions, it's a breakthrough.
</Person2><Person1>But there are caveats. It's not clear if it's a cure-all or if the benefits just come from tackling obesity, which causes so many other problems. And the cost... over a thousand dollars a month!
</Person1><Person2>And the benefits can go away if you stop taking the drug. So it's not a silver bullet, but it is a massive development in medicine.
</Person2><Person1>Speaking of massive developments, let's talk about instant commerce. The dream of getting what you want, when you want it, is getting closer. And the trick is simply... being physically closer.
</Person1><Person2>It's all about logistics. GoPuff is at the center of this. They're partnering with Disney to create custom mini-stores tied to Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN. The co-CEO said, "I can go from seeing an advertisement to having it in your hand in literally 15, 20 minutes."
</Person2><Person1>Fifteen minutes! That's incredible. They do it with hundreds of "micro-fulfillment centers" in major cities. And it’s not just Disney. Starbucks is piloting a program where their baristas make drinks inside GoPuff centers for rapid delivery.
</Person1><Person2>The brands themselves are driving this. They want that instant connection with the consumer. It's the next evolution of e-commerce.
</Person2><Person1>Okay, shifting gears to a much more somber topic. David Remnick at The New Yorker has a deeply reported piece on Israel's mood after its 12-day war with Iran.
</Person1><Person2>And the central theme is this uneasy mix of, quote, "euphoria and dread." There's triumphalism and talk of a golden age, but it's shadowed by the occupation and the moral cost of Gaza.
</Person2><Person1>Remnick writes that the "battered, nearly levelled cities of the Strip look like a reckoning deferred." It's a powerful point that Israel has always been better at winning wars than at winning what comes after.
</Person1><Person2>Exactly. The celebrations are real, but so is the dread... about the next missile, the next conflict. It's a very sobering read.
</Person2><Person1>To end on a slightly lighter, but still thought-provoking note... let's talk about high school English class. A new study finds that the list of most-taught books is... well, frozen in 1989.
</Person1><Person2>It's remarkable! Six of the top ten books taught today were also on the most-taught list from a study thirty-five years ago. We're talking Macbeth, Romeo and Juliet, The Great Gatsby...
</Person2><Person1>And this is happening while English teachers are battling what The Wall Street Journal calls "growing disengagement from teenagers" in the TikTok era, who have trouble focusing on full books. It's a fascinating cultural snapshot.
</Person1><Person2>It really is. You'd think the curriculum would have evolved more to meet the moment, but the classics, it seems, are holding on strong.
</Person2><Person1>A lot to think about today. That's all the time we have. Thanks for tuning in to Daily Metis News. We'll see you tomorrow.</Person1>
