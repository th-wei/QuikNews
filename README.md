## ðŸŽ§ Project Overview

This project transforms daily tech and business newslettersâ€”such as Axiosâ€”into concise, ~5-minute audio digests. The goal is to provide an easy, hands-free way to stay informed during busy mornings, serving as a lightweight alternative to broader news sources like NPR.

Whether you're getting ready for the day, commuting, or taking care of morning routines (like taking care of a dag), reading articles on your phone or computer isnâ€™t always practical. This audio format offers a convenient way to keep up with work and industry-relevant news while staying productive.

Is this a helpful tool to prepare for your day and stay ahead in your field? Let me know!
